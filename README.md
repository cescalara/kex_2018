KTH bachelor student project VT 2018

The aim of the project is to develop and optimise a simple classifier using a convolutional neural network 
for the reconstruction of tracks generated by a toy model. The motivation is to explore the possibility of 
using similar methods for the reconstruction of UHECR induced airshowers measured by fluorescence detection. 

The code is organised as follows:
* ```generate_sample_frames``` is a module used for the generation of training data based on a simple track model
* ```examples``` contains python notebooks explaining the use of the code
* ```development``` is the working directory of the project

The code has been tested using:

* python 3.6.4
* tflearn 0.3.2
* tensorflow 1.6.0

Run on both macOS High Sierra and Windows 7
